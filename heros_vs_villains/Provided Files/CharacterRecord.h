   on character name), it adds the character into the array of characters (heroes and

   members should be initialised to zero).  Increment the number of characters (heroes

   character (heroes and villains) array (Hint: shift all elements one position
   down the array).

/* This function takes the array of characters (heroes and villains) and the

   the location/index of the character stored in the array of characters.  This
   is useful so we can update the character's health value after every battle and
   battle statistics).

   This function prompts for and reads the number of battle rounds the heroes/villains
   will undertake (a number between 1-5 inclusive).  The function allows the heroes/villains
   to battle until either an opponent dies (health status is reduced to zero) or the number
   of battle rounds have been completed.  For each individual battle round, the hero/villain
   will sustain a certain amount of damage to their health rating.  The amount of damage
   sustained from the battle will be a randomly generated value between (0 - 50 inclusive).

   Algorithm is as follows-

         while (number of battle rounds have not been completed and both oppenents are still alive) {

	          randomly generate a damage value sustained from battle and update opponent 1's health
			  value by subtracting the damage value.

		      randomly generate a damage value sustained from battle and update opponent 2's health
			  value by subtracting the damage value.

			  display opponent 1 round results
			  display opponent 2 round results
	     }

		 determine the winner of the battles - the character with the most health left at the end of
		 all battle rounds is the winner.

		 display the winner to the screen and also report if a character has died as a result of battle.

         update opponent 1's battle statistics.  Hint: Increment the number of battles by one, number won, lost, drawn
		                                         accordingly.  We increment battles by one because battles may consist of
												 a number of battle rounds.

		 update oppenent 2's battle statistics.  Hint: Increment the number of battles by one, number won, lost, drawn
		                                         accordingly.  We increment battles by one because battles may consist of
												 a number of battle rounds.
